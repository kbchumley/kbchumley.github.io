       		 <h3>Behind the Name</h3>


		       	<p> Bixal Theory is a play off the design term “Color Theory”. Within color theory, understanding how to use different colors to convey meaning with appropraite accesibility is an important part of both design and marketing. At Bixal, similarly we believe that activating your strategic brain and leveling up your knowledge of human centered design and transformative technologies is a vital step in design accesibility. Bixal has a variety of cohesive brand colors that not only stands as a cohesive visual design unit but represents the diverse group of strategists, designers, engineers, and thinkers that we are.</p>

		       	<p> Here at Bixal we have a certain method and theory for getting things done the right way! Not limited to one minded thinking but welcoming all perspectives throughout this detailed process. To learn more and obtain more insight on creative strategy visit bixal.com</p>
